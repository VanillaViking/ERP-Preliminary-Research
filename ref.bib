ABSTRACT = {Diverse sensing techniques have been developed and combined with machine learning method for forest fire detection, but none of them referred to identifying smoldering and flaming combustion phases. This study attempts to real-time identify different combustion phases using a developed wireless sensor network (WSN)-based multi-sensor system and artificial neural network (ANN). Sensors (CO, CO2, smoke, air temperature and relative humidity) were integrated into one node of WSN. An experiment was conducted using burning materials from residual of forest to test responses of each node under no, smoldering-dominated and flaming-dominated combustion conditions. The results showed that the five sensors have reasonable responses to artificial forest fire. To reduce cost of the nodes, smoke, CO2 and temperature sensors were chiefly selected through correlation analysis. For achieving higher identification rate, an ANN model was built and trained with inputs of four sensor groups: smoke; smoke and CO2; smoke and temperature; smoke, CO2 and temperature. The model test results showed that multi-sensor input yielded higher predicting accuracy (≥82.5%) than single-sensor input (50.9%–92.5%). Based on these, it is possible to reduce the cost with a relatively high fire identification rate and potential application of the system can be tested in future under real forest condition.},

abstract = {As fires grow in intensity and frequency each year, so has the resistance from their anthropic victims in the form of firefighting technology and research. Although it is impossible to completely prevent wildfires, the potential devastation can be minimized if fires are detected and precisely geolocated while still in their nascent phases. Furthermore, automated approaches without human involvement are comparatively more efficient, accurate and capable of monitoring extremely remote and vast areas. With this specific intention, many research groups have proposed numerous approaches in the last several years, which can be grouped broadly into these four distinct categories: sensor nodes, unmanned aerial vehicles, camera networks and satellite surveillance. This review paper discusses notable advancements and trends in these categories, with subsequent shortcomings and challenges. We also describe a technical overview of common prototypes and several analysis models used to diagnose a fire from the raw input data. By writing this paper, we hoped to create a synopsis of the current state of technology in this emergent research area and provide a reference for further developments to other interested researchers.},

abstract={Fires in smart cities can have devastating consequences, causing damage to property, and endangering the lives of citizens. Traditional fire detection methods have limitations in terms of accuracy and speed, making it challenging to detect fires in real time. This paper proposes an improved fire detection approach for smart cities based on the YOLOv8 algorithm, called the smart fire detection system (SFDS), which leverages the strengths of deep learning to detect fire-specific features in real time. The SFDS approach has the potential to improve the accuracy of fire detection, reduce false alarms, and be cost-effective compared to traditional fire detection methods. It can also be extended to detect other objects of interest in smart cities, such as gas leaks or flooding. The proposed framework for a smart city consists of four primary layers: (i) Application layer, (ii) Fog layer, (iii) Cloud layer, and (iv) IoT layer. The proposed algorithm utilizes Fog and Cloud computing, along with the IoT layer, to collect and process data in real time, enabling faster response times and reducing the risk of damage to property and human life. The SFDS achieved state-of-the-art performance in terms of both precision and recall, with a high precision rate of 97.1{\%} for all classes. The proposed approach has several potential applications, including fire safety management in public areas, forest fire monitoring, and intelligent security systems.},

abstract = {The boundaries of tracking and sensing solutions are continuously being pushed. A stimulation in this field over recent years is exploiting the properties of millimeter wave (mmWave) radar to achieve simultaneous tracking and sensing of multiple objects. This paper aims to provide a critical analysis of the current literature surrounding multi-object tracking and sensing with short-range mmWave radar. There is significant literature available regarding single-object tracking using mmWave radar, demonstrating the maturity of single-object tracking systems. However, innovative research and advancements are also needed in the field of mmWave radar multi-object tracking, specifically with respect to uniquely identifying multiple target tracks across an interrupted field of view. In this article, we aim to provide an overview of the latest progress in multi-target tracking. In particular, an attempt to phrase the problem space is made by firstly defining a typical multi-object tracking architecture. We then highlight the areas for potential advancements. These areas include sensor fusion, micro-Doppler feature analysis, specialized and generalized activity recognition, gait, tagging and shape profile. Potential multi-object tracking advancements are reviewed and compared with respect to adaptability, performance, accuracy and specificity. Although the majority of the literature reviewed has a focus on human targets, most of the methodologies can be applied to targets consisting of different profiles and characteristics to that of humans. Lastly, future research directions are also discussed to shed light on research opportunities and potential approaches in the open research areas.},
